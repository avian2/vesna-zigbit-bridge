This is program bridges the serial line on the radio connector (USART3,
pins 9, 11) and RS-232 debug port on VESNA.

Specifically it allows direct communication with the ZigBit SerialNet
module on a SNR-MOD radio board from a terminal emulator program for
debugging or firmware reprogramming.

To compile:

$ make

To flash using OpenOCD and Olimex ARM-USB-OCD:

$ make zigbit-bridge.u

Use a serial terminal emulator to connect to VESNA's debug port. Use 115200
baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.
